# Safari Window for L/RHS Tabs (Alfred Workflow)

Move the safari tabs on left/right-hand-side to a new window by hotkeys (excludes the current tab)  

* `⌃` + `⇧` + `L`: move the safari tabs on LHS to a new window
* `⌃` + `⇧` + `R`: move the safari tabs on RHS to a new window

## Credits

* This workflow is inspired by the safari extension [yuanzhoucq/Tab-Space](https://github.com/yuanzhoucq/Tab-Space) and @gingerbeardman’s suggestion ([Tab-Space's issue 39](https://github.com/yuanzhoucq/Tab-Space/issues/39)).

* The icon is from [Open Tabs Icon #296010](https://icon-library.com/icon/open-tabs-icon-19.html).
