# Browser Tab Organizor (Alfred Workflow)

Re-organize tabs in Safari and Chrome - close, move, duplicate, convert, etc.:

* `⌃` + `L`: close left tabs
* `⌃` + `R`: close right tabs
* `⌃` + `⇧` + `L`: move left tabs to new window
* `⌃` + `⇧` + `R`: move right tabs to new window
* `⌃` + `W`: close all other tabs in current window
* `⌃` + `D`: duplicate current tab to the adjacent tab
* `⌃` + `⇧`  + `D`: duplicate current tab to the last tab
* `⌃` + `C`: move current tab from Safari to Chrome, or vice versa
* `⌃` + `⇧` + `C`: move all tabs in current window from Safari to Chrome, or vice versa
* `⌃` + `P`: move current tab to the private mode

TODO

* `⌃` + `B`: switch back to the most recent tab (ref. safari extention TabBack)
* `⌃` + `⇧` + `P`: duplicate current tab to the private mode
* `⌃` + `⇧` + `K`: move all tabs of current window back to the next lastest window as left tabs
* `⌃` + `⇧` + `E`: move all tabs of current window back to the next lastest window as right tabs

## Limitations

Note that I didn't add the feature that moves all tabs of *all windows* across browsers, as I don't see how it's useful to me, but you can add it easily via [here](https://gist.github.com/hanneskaeufler/4b94e292372639fde003729726500669) and welcome to pull back :)
